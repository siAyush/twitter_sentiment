Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer. The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose.

## Dependencies

1. tweepy 
2. textblob
Note: Before using it create twitter developer account and use your own keys. And paste 
those keys in the `script.py` code.

Install missing dependencies using pip

## Usage

`python3 script.py 'argument'`
